# Mass-Spectrometry-Chemical-Formula-Assigner
Script to perform various mass spectrometry-related routines including prediction of possible formulae from accurate masses and simulated spectrum generation

# Overview
Assignment of formulae to peaks of a given mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio is integral to many workflows in mass spectrometry and is often conducted using vendor-specific software. This script offers an alternative, python-based option for prediction of formulae for given m/z values, as well as an implementation of the brainpy algorithm for prediction of isotope distributions in simulated mass spectra (brainpy docs http://mobiusklein.github.io/brainpy).

To run a copy of this script locally the data_table.pkl file will need to be downloaded.

# Accepted limitations
This script has been provided as a useful tool and, whilst the base functionality works as intended, has not been extensively tested.
